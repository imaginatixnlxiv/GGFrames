**GGFrames**

GGFrames is webscrapper that uses the dustloop wiki to pull frame data about
Guilty Gear characters. This is my senior year capstone. This program will use
JFrame for all GUI aspects and Jaunt for all webscrapping aspects. My current
goal is to get the webscrapping working and have a working user interface. In the
future, I am planning on cleaning up the UI and adding character icons as opposed
to just the names on the characters. This is going to be a year long project
that hopefully will be completed by the end of my senior year.
