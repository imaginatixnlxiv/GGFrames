**GGFrames**

GGFrames is webscrapper that uses the [dustloop wiki](http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=GGXRD-R2/Frame_Data) to pull Guilty Gear
XRD Revealator 2 frame data. This is my senior year capstone. This program will use
JFrame for all GUI aspects and Jaunt API for all webscrapping aspects. My current
goal is to have a working UI and webscrapper. In the future, I plan on cleaning up
the UI and adding character icons as opposed to just the names of the characters.
This is going to be a year long project that hopefully will be completed by the end of the current school year.
